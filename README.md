## Component API

Animated components all accept the following **optional** properties.

#### durationMs [number]

The total duration (in milliseconds) of one iteration of the animation.

#### timingFunc [string]

Defines how animations progress through each cycle. Accepts any valid value of the [`animation-timing-function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function) CSS property.

#### iterations [number | "infinite"]

The number of times to loop the animation, or "infinite".
