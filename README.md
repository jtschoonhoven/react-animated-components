##### Easy-as-pie CSS animations for React.

_Because animations should be as easy as `<Rotate>ðŸ¥§</Rotate>`_

[Live Demo with Storybook](https://jtschoonhoven.github.io/react-animated-components)

Built with Typescript. Just one dependency (`styled-components` ðŸ’…).

## Install

```sh
npm install --save react-animated-components
```

## Use

```tsx
import { Rotate } from 'react-animated-components'

/** Pie is boring... let's animate it! **/
const BoringPie = () => <span>ðŸ¥§</span>

/** Pie is more delicious when it's rotating **/
const RotatingPie = () => {
  return (
    <Rotate>
      <BoringPie />
    </Rotate>
  )
}
```

## Component API

Animated components all accept the following **optional** properties.

#### active [boolean]

Controls when the animation begins. _Except for exit animations_, this defaults to true and animations begin automatically on mount. Exit animations do not run until `active` is set explicitly.

#### durationMs [number]

The total duration (in milliseconds) of one iteration of the animation.

#### timingFunc [string]

Defines how animations progress through each cycle. Accepts any valid value of the [`animation-timing-function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function) CSS property.

#### iterations [number | "infinite"]

The number of times to loop the animation, or "infinite".

#### onComplete [() => void]

Callback function, called when animation is complete. Useful for garbage collecting components that have exited, or for composing complex chains of effects.

#### display ["inline-block" | "block"]

A shorthand to set the CSS "display" property. **Do not use "inline"** this cannot be animated. Any valid CSS display property is valid, but in practice you should use either "inline-block" (the default) or "block".
